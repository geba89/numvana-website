            <div class="faq-item">
                <button class="faq-question">What is Numvana?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Numvana is a meditative number-merging puzzle game played on a hexagonal grid. Swipe in any of six directions to slide tiles across the board. When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one tile with double the value. The goal is to create increasingly higher-value tiles &mdash; from Morning Mist (2) all the way to Golden Dawn (2048) and beyond.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button class="faq-question">How is this different from 2048?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>While inspired by 2048, Numvana introduces several key differences. The hexagonal grid allows six directions of movement instead of four, creating new strategic possibilities. Zen mode has no game over &mdash; the grid expands when full. Challenge mode adds a rising water mechanic instead of a simple "board full" end state. Every tile has a nature-inspired name and color, and the game includes a built-in Pomodoro focus timer.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button class="faq-question">What are the game modes?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p><strong>Zen Mode:</strong> Endless, pressure-free gameplay. No time limit, no game over. When the grid fills up, it automatically expands. Play at your own pace and see how high you can go. Score display is optional.</p>
                    <p><strong>Challenge Mode:</strong> Water rises from the bottom of the grid every few swipes, destroying submerged tiles. Merge tiles into 128 or higher to push the water back. The game ends when water covers half the grid. Choose from three difficulty levels: Gentle, Flow, or Torrent.</p>
                    <p><strong>Daily Challenge:</strong> One puzzle every day, the same for all players. A seeded tile sequence ensures fairness. Your score determines a star rating: Bronze, Silver, or Gold. You get two attempts per day.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button class="faq-question">What do the tile names mean?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Each tile value has a nature-inspired name and a unique color:</p>
                    <p>2: Morning Mist &middot; 4: Silver Rain &middot; 8: Spring Water &middot; 16: Clear Sky &middot; 32: Forest Moss &middot; 64: Ocean Glass &middot; 128: Honey Light &middot; 256: Sunset Coral &middot; 512: Autumn Berry &middot; 1024: Twilight &middot; 2048: Golden Dawn &middot; 4096: Cherry Blossom</p>
                    <p>The names reflect the journey from calm beginnings to radiant achievement.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button class="faq-question">How does water pushback work in Challenge mode?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>When you merge tiles into a value of 128 (Honey Light) or higher, the water level drops by one row. This earns you 50 bonus points and buys more time. Strategic high-value merges are key to surviving longer in Challenge mode.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button class="faq-question">Can I save my progress?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>In Zen mode, your game auto-saves whenever you leave the app or navigate back to the main menu. You can resume right where you left off. In Challenge mode, games are not saved between sessions &mdash; each game is a fresh attempt, like an arcade experience.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button class="faq-question">How does scoring work?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Each merge earns points equal to the resulting tile value (e.g., merging two 64s into 128 earns 128 points). Bonus multipliers apply for combos: 3+ merges in one swipe earn a 1.5x bonus, and 4+ merges earn a 2.0x bonus. Milestone bonuses are awarded when you first reach 256 (+500), 512 (+1,000), 1024 (+2,000), and 2048 (+5,000) in a game. All points contribute to your lifetime score for achievements.</p>

            <!-- FOCUS TIMER -->
            <p class="faq-category">Focus Timer</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button class="faq-question">What is the Focus Timer?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The Focus Timer is a built-in Pomodoro productivity tool. It alternates between focused work periods (where the game is locked) and break periods (where you play Zen mode as a reward). Set your work duration, break length, and number of cycles in Settings. The game becomes your incentive for staying focused.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button class="faq-question">How do I configure the Focus Timer?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Go to Settings (gear icon on the main menu) and find the "Focus Timer" section. You can customize:</p>
                    <p><strong>Work Duration:</strong> 15, 20, 25, 30, 45, or 60 minutes (default: 25 minutes)<br>
                    <strong>Break Duration:</strong> 5, 10, 15, or 20 minutes (default: 5 minutes)<br>
                    <strong>Pomodoros:</strong> 1 to 8 cycles per session (default: 4)<br>
                    <strong>Long Break:</strong> 15, 20, or 30 minutes (default: 15 minutes)</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button class="faq-question">What happens if I leave the app during a Focus Timer session?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The timer continues tracking time in the background. When you return, it recalibrates automatically. If a phase ended while you were away, the timer advances to the correct phase. You'll also receive a notification when work or break phases end, so you can come back at the right moment.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button class="faq-question">Can I cancel a Focus Timer session early?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes. Tap "End Session" at the bottom of the work countdown screen at any time. This cancels the remaining session and returns you to the main menu.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button class="faq-question">What is the long break?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>After completing all pomodoros in a session, you'll see a summary screen with your stats. From there, you can choose "Take a Long Break" which gives you an extended play session (configurable from 15 to 30 minutes). This is the traditional Pomodoro technique's long break, with Numvana as the reward.</p>

                    <p>Yes, Numvana is free and supported by non-intrusive ads shown between game sessions (never during gameplay). Ads are rate-limited: a maximum of one every 4 minutes, with a daily cap of 4 ads. Your first few sessions are completely ad-free.
